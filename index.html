                I started working after I finish high school at TecMilenio, my first job was at Teleperformance, that was a call center right next to my school so it was really close to me.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason I started working was to start gaining experience, practice my english with customer from the US and start getting money to buy things that I wanted at that time.
            </p>

            <p>
                After working at Teleperformance for a while, I decided to look for new opportunities to grow professionally. I found a job at a tech company where I could use my English skills more effectively and work on interesting projects.

                    While the pandemic hit, I was working from home office thorugh all the 2 years, thats were I started linking more the computer, being at my room, self studing and watching tutorials.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I decided to make a career change and start learning programming. I began taking online courses and practicing coding in my free time. 
                    I liked the opportunities, the options to always keep learning and the good salaries that the tech industry offers.

                    To accelerate my learning, I decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp. Academlo, where I learned the fundamentals of web development and built several projects.
